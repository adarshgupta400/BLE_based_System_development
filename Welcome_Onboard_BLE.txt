WELCOME to onboard.

Please read ahead and familiarize yourself with our group chats. On a weekly basis we have meetings on Skype. see below for links.

PROJECT:
   In this chat we are developing an ANDROID app using Kotlin programming language, the app must be BLE functionality.

The goal here, is to develop an app with personal tracking and access monitoring solutions -  Bluetooth Low energy (BLE) targeting for beacon accuracy 'indoor' positioning. 
Not to worry if you do not have any prior experience in developing apps. This is the learning curve of the internship.

Also, for referencing GAOrfid.com take a look at GAOTek product page on beacons, which as you proceed will begin to make sense.

Now download this file â€“ concentrate on the Android app portion and the reference material related to the development of a beacon, the information in the zip file will make sense as you proceed in building your app.

Feel free to contact Prabhjot Dhaliwal(Team Leader) or  (Assistant Team Leader) personally if you should become overwhelmed, or require personal assistant of any kind.

Some of the BLE interns in this chat have been working on this Android app for over three months,
 so do not be discourage as interns are all at different stages on the development of the Android app. The goal is to be optimistic and succeed in your internship.

In the Skype chat you will find that there is some difference than what is discussed in this chat, this chat is for relevancy and managerial updates.
Your next step is to choose an Integrated Development Environments (IDE) -  you will need it to develop the Android app, the Android Studio IDE is the popular choice in this group.

Here are the links for Skype.
